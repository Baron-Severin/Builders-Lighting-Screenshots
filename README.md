This Builders Lighting application is a tool for lighting contractors to keep track of required items for large-scale ordering. The app allows contractors to easily keep track of items required while out on site visits with a well-defined project structure. Users can sync this information with the builders lighting website and quickly complete the ordering process from there.

The screenshots above show four different secnarios within the application.
 - The first is the login page, with a clean and intuitive interface.
 - The second is the homepage, where the user can view all of their active projects.
 - The third shows the details tab of the individual project screen.
 - The fourth shows the navigation drawer, which is viewable throughout the application to allow users to easily navigate.

###Summary
#######

This project was a group project, undertaken as part of the Android Immersive program as General Assembly in Seattle. Our team of three developers was given an application currently used by Builders Lighting and asked to reconstruct the application with a more user-friendly and streamlined service.

Within a two week time frame we were able to create an intuitive and user-friendly application that the client was extremely pleased with.
